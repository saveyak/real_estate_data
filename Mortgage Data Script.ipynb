    "The Mortgage Bankers Association sends a press release every week with the results of their weekly mortgage applications survey. The survey covers over 75% of all applications for retail residential mortgages in the U.S., and contains a huge wealth of information, including interest rates and changes in the number of applications. These press releases are all available on [one page](https://www.mba.org/news-research-and-resources/research-and-economics/single-family-research/weekly-applications-survey/research-and-economics-all-news-about-mbas-weekly-applications-survey) and go back to 2016. The survey itself has been conducted since 1990. Find more information about the survey [here](https://www.mba.org/Documents/mba.org/files/Research/HistoricalWAS/WASFAQ.pdf). \n",
